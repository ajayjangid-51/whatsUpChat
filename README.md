Messenging App

I developed a photo sharing and chat messaging web application similar to Instagram and WhatsApp using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The application allows users to upload and share photos, as well as search, follow and message other users in real-time.

The application features a user-friendly interface that allows users to browse, like, and comment on photos, as well as message other users. I used Firebase Authentication for signin with Google accounts. 

I used MongoDB to store the user and photo data, and used Mongoose for data modeling and validation. I also implemented a feature for image compression and optimization to ensure that photos can be displayed quickly and efficiently.

I used Redux for managing the application's state. Additionally, I implemented a search feature and filtering options to help users quickly find the photos and users they are looking for.

Additionally, I am deciding to implemented Push Notifications to alert users of incoming messages even when they are not actively using the app.

The application was designed to have similar user interface and functionality as Instagram and WhatsApp, making it easy for users to navigate and use. The goal of this project was to create a powerful, safe&secure and easy-to-use platform for photo sharing and messaging that can be used for personal and professional use.
